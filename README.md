# Fletching Script
Gametick trigger count: 3
This script allows you to fletch different types of logs into either longbows or shortbows with the use of bowstrings. You can specify the log type and the type of bow to fletch.

## Usage

1. Start the script.
2. Set the desired log type and bow type by modifying the following variables:
   - `log_decision`: Determines the log type to use (0 = magic, 1 = yew, 2 = maple, 3 = willow).
   - `bow_decision`: Determines the bow type to fletch (0 = longbow, 1 = shortbow).
3. Ensure you have the necessary items are in the bank visibible for fletching, including a bow string.
4. The script will perform the following actions based on your selections:
   - Withdraw the required materials from the bank.
   - Fletch the desired bow type using the selected log.
   - Deposit the finished bows into the bank if the inventory is full.
   - Repeat the process until the desired fletching level is reached.
